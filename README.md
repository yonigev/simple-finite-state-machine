# Simple finite state machine (sfsm)
This library allows Kotlin & Java developers to use  a _**simplified**_ (hence the word _simple_) **State Machine** model.
#### **This project is still under development!**

### You can find this useful if:
* You are writing a state-based application with a simple Trigger -> Transition logic
* You can describe the problem you are solving using a basic State Machine diagram.
* You do _**not**_ require any fancy Statemachine features like Junction, Choice states or Regions.
